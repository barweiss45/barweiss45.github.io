## What Are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are powerful scripts that are automatically triggered by various Git events, such as committing, pushing, or receiving changes. They are designed to automate tasks and enforce certain workflows or policies throughout the lifecycle of a repository. Git hooks can be used for actions like validating commit messages, running tests, or checking for proper code formatting before code is pushed or merged.

The scripts are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory inside a Git repository. When a repository is initialized with `git init`, Git populates this directory with several example hook scripts (with a `.sample` extension). These are disabled by default, but they can be activated by removing the `.sample` extension and making them executable.

There are two main types of Git hooks: **client-side** and **server-side**.

## Client-Side Hooks

Client-side hooks run on the local machine where Git operations, such as committing or merging, are performed. These hooks are useful for enforcing rules and automating tasks locally before changes are pushed to a remote repository. Some common client-side hooks include:

- **pre-commit**: Executes before a commit is made, allowing inspection or modifications to the changes before they are committed.
- **prepare-commit-msg**: Runs before the commit message editor is launched, allowing customization or prepopulation of commit messages.
- **commit-msg**: Runs after the commit message is entered, allowing validation of the message format or content.
- **post-commit**: Executes after the commit is completed, and can be used for notifications or to trigger further actions.
- **pre-push**: Runs before objects are transferred during a `git push`, allowing checks on the state of the repository before pushing to the remote.

These hooks can be used to enforce local policies such as code formatting, linting, or running tests before a commit or push.

## Server-Side Hooks

Server-side hooks are executed on the server that hosts the Git repository. These hooks typically handle network operations, such as when a client pushes changes to the server. Some common server-side hooks include:

- **pre-receive**: Runs before any commits are accepted by the server, making it useful for enforcing server-side policies such as ensuring all commits pass certain tests or follow a specific structure.
- **update**: Runs for each branch being pushed and checks whether the push should be allowed, based on specific branch-level policies.
- **post-receive**: Runs after the push is completed and can be used to update other services, trigger CI/CD pipelines, or send notifications to teams.

While client-side hooks operate locally and can be bypassed by the developer, server-side hooks enforce policies across the entire team, ensuring consistent rules are followed by everyone contributing to the repository.

### Important Considerations for Hooks

- Client-side hooks are **not transferred** when cloning a repository. To distribute hooks across team members, they must be shared manually or using configuration management tools like Git submodules or repositories.
- Hooks can be written in any scripting language that is executable, such as shell, Python, or Ruby. Git provides example hooks, often written in shell or Perl, but any script that can run on your system will work.
  
For detailed information on all available hooks and how to implement them, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).

## Example: A Pre-Push Hook to Automate `git pull` Checks

One common use case for a Git hook is ensuring that the local branch is up-to-date with the remote before pushing changes. This can prevent merge conflicts and errors that arise from outdated code being pushed. A pre-push hook can automate this check, ensuring that developers pull the latest changes before pushing.

### Steps to Set Up a Pre-Push Hook

1. Navigate to the `.git/hooks` directory in your local repository.
   
   ```bash
   cd .git/hooks
   ```

2. Create a new file named `pre-push` (without any extension).

   ```bash
   touch pre-push
   ```

3. Make the `pre-push` file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pre-push
   ```

4. Edit the `pre-push` file to include the following script, which checks if the local branch is behind the remote branch:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Determine the current branch name
   branch=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD | sed -e 's,.*/\(.*\),\1,')

   # Fetch updates from the remote repository
   if git fetch --quiet && git log HEAD..origin/$branch --oneline | grep -q '.*'; then
       echo "Your branch is behind 'origin/$branch'. Please pull the latest changes before pushing."
       exit 1
   fi

   exit 0
   ```

### What the Script Does:

- Retrieves the name of the current branch.
- Fetches the latest state of the remote branch to compare it with the local branch.
- Checks if the local branch is behind the remote branch by inspecting the commit logs.
- If the local branch is outdated, it prints a warning and aborts the push by exiting with a non-zero status.
- If the branch is up-to-date, the push continues without interruption.

### Customizing the Script

- For more complex workflows or branching strategies, the script can be modified to handle multiple remotes or branches.
- The script can also be extended to perform additional checks, such as verifying that tests pass before pushing.

This basic example is just the starting point for what can be achieved with Git hooks. From code quality checks to automating complex workflows, Git hooks are a versatile tool for ensuring consistency across development teams.

## Conclusion

Git hooks offer a powerful mechanism for automating tasks and enforcing standards throughout the development process. By setting up client-side hooks, developers can ensure their changes meet project requirements before they are pushed to the server, while server-side hooks provide a robust way to enforce policies across the entire team.

Whether you're validating commit messages, running tests before every push, or enforcing a code review process, Git hooks can streamline and enhance your development workflow, helping teams maintain quality and consistency at every step.
